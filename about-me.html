   About me 
    </h2>
    <figcaption>
  <p>Having completed a master's degree in Geology, I have a keen interest in discussing topics such as rock formations and volcanology. I have always been fascinated by the way the Earth's processes shape the landscape and how the ocean interacts with it. I think it is important to advocate for sustainability.</p>
  
  <p>For my Master I did two projects that focused on the geological conditions surrounding the Great Oxidation Event (GOE). The GOE is a term used to describe a significant increase in the level of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere that occurred around 2.4 billion years ago. Prior to the GOE, the Earth's atmosphere contained little to no free oxygen. The GOE also had a significant impact on the Earth's climate and geology, causing changes in weather patterns, and the formation of new minerals. The rise of oxygen levels also allowed for the evolution of new life forms.</p>
  
  <p>I also have an interest in technology and the way it is evolving with time. I like to tinker with Linux systems and certain gadgets. I am always eager to learn and explore new ideas and at the moment my main interests lay on IT related things, such as open source software, Linux, development, and cybersecurity. So I am currently studying for some IT certifications such as OSCP.</p>
